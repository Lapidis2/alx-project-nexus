###  Key Frontend Concepts Learned

- Component-based architecture
- State management ( Context API)
- Client-side vs server-side rendering
- Accessibility and responsive design
- Performance optimization techniques
- Error handling and user feedback systems


### Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Integrating complex APIs | Broke down requests into reusable hooks and used GraphQL fragments |

###  Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

- Prioritize **readability and maintainability** in code.
- Write **reusable and testable components**.
- Use **version control** (Git) effectively — feature branching, atomic commits.
- Adopt **CI/CD workflows** to automate builds and deployments.
- Document everything — from components to API endpoints.
  
### Final Thoughts

This program not only helped solidify my frontend development skills but also instilled a mindset of building for scale and maintainability. I now feel confident in approaching real-world frontend projects with a structured and efficient workflow.
